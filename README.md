I've been using SoundCloud since I was 13 and I use it more than any other app on my phone. I love that you can comment, repost, and DM people. It's kind of like a social media app, but for music, almost like a forum page but all the music is there too listen to on top of it. That's what inspired this project. I wanted to make a fun game out of exploring all the songs I've been reposting on SoundCloud.

The game works by having boxes with covers: you scratch the gray overlay to see the cover and the music plays. If you scratch more than one at the same time the music overlaps sounding awful which is the challenge. I wanted to make the music stop automatically when a box is done but I couldnt find any tutorials on it and even AI couldnt help me do it. It's also annoying that you have to listen to the full song before the next one can start I could have easily fixed this by putting snippets of the songs but due to bad time managment I didnt get to do this.

I also wanted the canvas to fill the screen and be able to have as many songs as possible, but didnt have the sufficient time to fill up all squares on the canvas.

Built with p5.js for the canvas and scratch interaction, p5.sound for the songs, normal HTML/CSS for page

I also overcame my original issues by changing the site into a game. My orignal idea found in "sketchOLD.js" was to have all the images and songs layered into one canvas where you could scratch through each song revealing the next one underneath but this was too hard(the images wouldnt change after scratching the first one fully) so I switched it to being spread out.
